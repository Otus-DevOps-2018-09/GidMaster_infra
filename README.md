## Home assignment #3:
1. Get access to "someinternalhost" VM instance trough "`bastion`" from external host use one-liner connections string.
```
Username: gpc.syrovatsky;
Auth type: ssh-rsa;
Proxy host: bastion.
```
Answer:

Command: `ssh -t -i ~/.ssh/gcp.syrovatsky -A gcp.syrovatsky@bastion 'ssh someinternalhost'`  

Arguments:
* ssh - Open SSH session;
* -t - Force pseudo-terminal allocation to to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on	a remote machine;
* -i [`IDENTITY_FILE`] - Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication	is read;
* -A - Enables forwarding	of the authentication agent connectionl
* [`USERNAME`]@[`HOST`] - username and host address for SSH connection;
* '[`COMMAND`]' - execute command on remote host. In our case open ssh connection to "`someinternalhost`";

2. Get access to "`someinternalhost`" VM instance from external host by command "ssh someinternalhost".
```
Username: gpc.syrovatsky;
Auth type: ssh-rsa;
Proxy host: bastion;
Extra conditions: External machine's public key already palced on "bastion" and "someinternalhost" VM instances.
```
Ansewer:

We should make/change "`~/.ssh/config`" file to use "bastion" as proxy.

Minimal configuration should look:

"`cat ~/.ssh/config`"
```
Host someinternalhost
    ForwardAgent yes
    User gcp.syrovatsky
    ProxyCommand ssh -v -t -i ~/.ssh/gcp.syrovatsky -A gcp.syrovatsky@bastion nc %h %p
```
Where:
* "ForwardAgent yes" - Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any) will be forwarded to the remote machine.
* "User gcp.syrovatsky" - current user for connection
* "ProxyCommand" - Command that should be executed to get access to remote machine.
*     You can see that is a little diffirent from previous assignment. instead of "ssh someinternalhost" we use "nc %h %p".

But I decided to modify "`~/.ssh/config`" to make it more useful for future use:

"`cat ~/.ssh/config`"
```
Host someinternalhost
    ForwardAgent yes
    User gcp.syrovatsky
    ProxyCommand ssh -v bastion nc %h %p
Host bastion
    HostName [IP_ADDRESS_OF_BASTION]
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gcp.syrovatsky
    User gcp.syrovatsky
```

3. IP addresses for checking task with VPN-server:
```
bastion_IP = 35.210.14.191
someinternalhost_IP = 10.132.0.3    
URL_pritunl: "https://pritunl.35.210.14.191.sslip.io"
```

## Home assignment #4:

Additional tasks solution:

1. Make configuration for puma-server using gcloud CLI to run VM instance with startup script:
```
  sudo gcloud compute instances create reddit-app \
  --boot-disk-size=10GB \
  --image-family ubuntu-1604-lts \
  --image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud \
  --machine-type=g1-small \
  --tags puma-server \
  --metadata-from-file \
  startup-script=startup-script.sh \
  --restart-on-failure \
```  

2.  Make firewall rule default-puma-server for puma-server using gcloud CLI
```
  sudo gcloud compute firewall-rules create default-puma-server \
  --action allow \
  --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0 \
  --target-tags puma-server \
  --rules tcp:9292 \
  --direction INGRESS \
```
## Home assignment #5:

1. Studied foundation of Packer usage.
2. Made 1st packer template "`packer\ubuntu16.json`" with testApp installation.
3. Deployed testApp from VM image based on Packer template, ehich created before.
4. Parameterized Packer template with help of "`packer\variables.json`".
5. Made "baked" VM image with help of Packer template "`packer\immutable.json`".
6. Made script for automatic VM instance creation from "baked" VM image.
